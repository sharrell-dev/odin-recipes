    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons of sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup of heavy creamy</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk 3 tablespoons sugar and cream in a microwave-safe bowl until well combined; heat the mixture in microwave until warm, 1 to 2 minutes, and whisk again to dissolve sugar. Whisk in egg yolks and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour cream mixture into 2 ramekins. Set ramekins into a roasting pan and pour in enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until creme desserts are set but still slightly jiggly when shaken, about 50 minutes. Remove ramekins from hot water and chill in refrigerator until cold, at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar evenly over the top of each dessert. Use a kitchen torch to lightly toast and melt the sugar topping until brown and bubbly, about 30 seconds. Let the sugar topping cool before serving. To serve, use a spoon to crack the crisp sugar open to reveal the creamy dessert underneath.</li>
    </ol>
